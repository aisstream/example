# Description 
This repository contains examples of using the AISStream API in Golang, Python, JavaScript and many more languages.

## Prerequisites
Before you can use these examples, you will need to sign up for an AISStream API key at [aisstream.io](https://aisstream.io/authenticate).

### Golang Example
To run the Golang example, you will need to have Go installed on your system.

Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/aisstream/example`. Navigate to the golang directory: `cd example/golang`. Install the dependencies: `go get -d`. Replace `"<YOUR API KEY>"` in the `main.go` file with your AISStream API key. Run the example: `go run main.go`.

### Python Example
To run the Python example, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your system.

Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/aisstream/example`. Navigate to the python directory: `cd example/python`. Install the dependencies: `python setup.py install`. Replace `"<YOUR API KEY>"` in the `main.py` file with your AISStream API key. Run the example: python main.py.
  
### JavaScript Example
To run the JavaScript example, you will need to have Node.js installed on your system.

Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/aisstream/example`. Navigate to the javascript directory: `cd example/javascript`. Install the dependencies: `npm install`. Replace `"<YOUR API KEY>"` in the `main.js` file with your AISStream API key.. Run the example: `node main.js`.

### C++ Examples
To build the C++ examples, you will need to have [CMake 3.20+](https://cmake.org/) and OpenSSL installed on your system. Two C++ examples are available. One with [Boost.Beast](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_84_0/libs/beast/doc/html/index.html) and one with [Qt](https://www.qt.io/download-open-source).
